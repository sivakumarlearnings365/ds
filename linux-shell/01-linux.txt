$ usermod -aG docker ubuntu($USER) --> current user, executes all docker related commands
$ newgrp docker --> to apply chnages immediately

$ usermod -s /bin/bash aditya

$ deluser aditya

$ addgroup group1
$ delgroup group1

to add anyuser to sudo group, they can use sudo command:
    $ usermod -aG sudo syam

directory structure:
=======================
Here's a short summary of the Linux directory structure with common use cases:

/bin – Essential User Commands
    Use: Basic commands needed for all users.
    Example:
        /bin/ls – lists directory contents
        /bin/cp – copies files
    Third-party: Usually not for third-party apps; strictly core tools.
/sbin – System Binaries
    Use: Admin tools used for system maintenance.
    Example:
        /sbin/iptables – firewall tool
        /sbin/reboot – restarts the system
    Third-party: Admin tools from packages like net-tools, lvm2 may install here.
/etc – Configuration Files
    Use: System-wide config files.
    Example:
        /etc/nginx/nginx.conf – NGINX config
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config – SSH server settings
    Third-party: Almost all third-party apps store configs here.
        /etc/mysql/my.cnf – MySQL config
        /etc/docker/daemon.json – Docker config
/opt – Optional/Third-party Software
    Use: Large third-party software packages.
    ex: tomcat...
/usr – Secondary Hierarchy (user apps & tools)
IT CONATIMS FOLDER --> bin(application), lib, share(docs, icons,fomts..), local (apps installed maually)
    Use: Non-essential software and libraries.
    Example:
        /usr/bin/python3 – Python binary
        /usr/share/fonts – System fonts
    Third-party: Many installed tools go here:
        /usr/lib/docker/
        /usr/bin/code – VS Code launcher
/dev --> h/w and virtual devices
        /dev/sda....
/proc --> process related info
        /proc/cpuinfo
/sys --> kernal info
        drivers, devices, ..
/home --> users home directory
    default directories are .bashrc, .bash_profile
/boot --> boting related info
    initrd.img
/lib --> shared libraries of bin & sbin
/run --> voilatile info like pid of services
/srv --> service realted data by system services
        /srv/ftp, /srv/www ->hosting websites


============================================
users realted:
----------------
-----------------
    diff b/w adduser and useradd
    -------------------------
        adduser -> its more interactive , use while crreating manually
        useradd -> use in scripts

    groups:
    ----------
    $ addgroup devops
    $ usermod -g devops siva --> for siva devops is the primary group
    $ usermod -aG devops,infra siva --> for siva devops,infra are secondary groups

    to delete users, groups:
    ------------------------
    $ deluser siva
    $ delgroup devops

vi editor:
==========
    gg -> beginning of file
    G -> end of file
    0 -> beginnig of current line
    $ -> end of current line
    w -> begiinging of nxt wrd
    b -> begng of current wrd
    dd -> delete current line
    A -> inser mode at end of line
    I -> insert mode at begng of line
    o -> open newlinebelow current line

permissions:
===========
    owner - u
    group - g 
    other - o 
    + add 
    - remove 
        chmod u=rwx folder-1,  chmod g=--x -R folder-1,  chmod g+w -R folder1 
owners:
---------
    chown siva -R folder-1 --> chnages only primary owner
    chown :devops -R folder-1 --> chnages only group owner
