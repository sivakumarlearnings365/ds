Jenkins:
=========
    prereqs:
    1) java
runs on port 8080

    Tools Section (Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration)
    ======================================================
    This is where you define tool installations used in your Jenkins jobs.
        Examples: JDKs, Maven, Gradle, Git, SonarScanner, etc.
    You specify:
    Tool name (used in pipeline or freestyle jobs)

     System Section (Manage Jenkins → Configure System)
     ===================================================
    This is where you configure global settings and behaviors for Jenkins and its plugins.
    For plugins like SonarQube, this is where you configure:
        SonarQube server URL
        Authentication tokens
        Webhooks

    This is system-facing: It’s about how Jenkins integrates with external services globally.
