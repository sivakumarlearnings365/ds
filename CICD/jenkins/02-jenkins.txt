webhook triggers:
====================
    ex: automating pielines,
        when developer pushes code to feature branch of git repo, then pipeline starts executing automatically and performs compilation, test, build(artifcats), security check

    configuration:
    ------------------
    install plugin -> generic webhook triggger(specific to pipeline) ,
    now go to pipeline job -> trigger -> generic webhook trigger check it and now add post content parameters
        variable - ref
        expresiion - $.ref (json)
        token & token credentials -> both are for authrization, token is visible which is not good
            token credential -> add -> jenkins -> secret text -> secret(devopsshack123) -> id(token-webhook)
        optional filter -> to specify the branch 
            expresiion - refs/heads/dev 
            text - $ref
    above configuration is from jenkins side now need to do from github side:
    ------------------------------------------------
    github repo -> settings -> webhook -> addwebhook
    copy URL & query parameter  from jenkins under Token section
        ex: http://<jenkins_url>:8080/generic-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=devopsshack123 
    add above genetared URl in github payload, and conetnt type -> application/json -> addwebhook
    to check status -> clilck on webhooks -> recent deliveries shows tick mark 

    in jenkins console o/p it shows "generic cause" 


    multi branch pipeline:
    =========================
    jobs -> multi branch pipeline -> branch source: git -> git repo details(https://github.com/jaiswaladi246/Boardgame.git) -> build configuration(mode: jenkinsfile) -> apply changes(before this check below steps, if pipeline has tools section) 

        first time this job start executing all branches automatically, now we can configure github hook for multibranch pipeline with below steps 

        for pipeline and multi branch pipeline jobs install plugins -> stage view, multi branch scan  webhook trigger 

        for tools, add plugin for java  -> eclipe termuin installer 
        after installing plugins configure inside tools section 
        to add jdk 
            tools -> JDk installtions -> Name: jdk17 -> selct install automatically -> adoptium.net -> select java version(jdk17)

            maven -> name:3.6 -> install automatically from apache -> select version(3.6.1) 
    
    NOw go to job -> configure -> scan multi branch pipeline triggers under build configurations , selct scan by web hook -> trigger token(multibranch123) -> click on ? symbol and copy URl and modify it 
        ex: http://<jenkins ip>:8080/multibranch-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=<value> (multibranch123)

    above is payload url for multibranch pipeline
    now go to github -> settings -> webhooks -> addwebhook -> add payload URl -> content type: application/json -> addwebhooks 

    now modify code in main branch , it will trigger multi branch pipeline job automatically but only main branch pipeline  -> shows started  by indexing

    similarly test othe branches 

    ============ 30 ================


    


upstream & downstream jobs:
==============================
we can maintain two individual jobs CI and CD jobs as upsteam and downstream, once CI is completed automatically CD will start executing 
here CD job is automatic depends on CI job as weel as it can be triggered manually
