Trivy: ( Triple vulnarability sacnner)
========================================
1) sacn dependencies in our project
2) sacn source code for sensitivie data
3)scan for misconfigurations like kubernatese files 


CVE (common vulnarability & exposer)
--------------------------------
there is a common databse whre all vulnarabilities and its fixes are mentioned in database ,
whenever we scan data with trivy, it will scan all dependencies and cross check with database and genetaes o/p. 

owasp dependency check also will do same job, but owasp  uses only NVD(natinal vulnarability depency) database to scan dependencies , similarly we have other DBS like Redhat, Linux... where Trivy has huge exposer on most DBs 

owasp depedency check will perform only dependencies check but trivy has other features also

Trivy can be directly installed on jenknins m/c
